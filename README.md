# TypeWise (v2)

TypeWise v2 is a modern, production-ready typing practice web application.  
This version reimplements the original TypeWise using a modern TypeScript-first stack and adds configurable timed modes, improved analytics, and user search.

## Highlights
- Timed practice: preset and custom timers (train for speed or accuracy).
- Accuracy-first mode (no timer) & hybrid scoring (time + accuracy).
- Stats page with historical session metrics and visual summaries.
- Search users to discover other learners and compare stats.
- Modern stack: Next.js (frontend), NestJS (backend), Prisma + PostgreSQL/MongoDB (DB), TypeScript, and Shadcn UI primitives.
